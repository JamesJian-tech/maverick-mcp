# Speed Testing Framework for MaverickMCP Research Agents

This document describes the comprehensive speed testing framework developed to validate and monitor the speed optimizations implemented in the MaverickMCP research system.

## Overview

The speed testing framework validates the following optimization claims:
- **2-3x speed improvements** over baseline performance
- **Sub-30s completion times** for emergency scenarios
- **Resolution of timeout issues** (previously 138s, 129s failures)
- **Intelligent model selection** for time-critical scenarios
- **Adaptive optimization** based on query complexity and time constraints

## Framework Components

### 1. Speed Optimization Validation Tests (`tests/test_speed_optimization_validation.py`)

Comprehensive pytest-based test suite that validates:

#### Core Components Tested
- **Adaptive Model Selection**: Verifies fastest models are chosen for emergency scenarios
- **Progressive Token Budgeting**: Tests time-aware token allocation
- **Parallel LLM Processing**: Validates batch processing optimizations
- **Confidence Tracking**: Tests early termination logic
- **Content Filtering**: Validates intelligent source prioritization

#### Query Complexity Levels
- **Simple**: Basic queries (target: <15s completion)
- **Moderate**: Standard analysis queries (target: <25s completion)  
- **Complex**: Comprehensive research queries (target: <35s completion)
- **Emergency**: Time-critical queries (target: <30s completion)

#### Expected Model Selections
```python
EXPECTED_MODEL_SELECTIONS = {
    QueryComplexity.EMERGENCY: ["google/gemini-2.5-flash", "openai/gpt-4o-mini"],
    QueryComplexity.SIMPLE: ["google/gemini-2.5-flash", "openai/gpt-4o-mini"],
    QueryComplexity.MODERATE: ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "google/gemini-2.5-flash"],
    QueryComplexity.COMPLEX: ["anthropic/claude-sonnet-4", "google/gemini-2.5-pro"],
}
```

#### Model Speed Benchmarks
```python
MODEL_SPEED_BENCHMARKS = {
    "google/gemini-2.5-flash": 199,    # tokens/second - FASTEST
    "openai/gpt-4o-mini": 126,         # tokens/second - FAST
    "anthropic/claude-haiku": 89,      # tokens/second - MODERATE
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4": 45,   # tokens/second - COMPREHENSIVE
    "google/gemini-2.5-pro": 25, # tokens/second - DEEP
}
```

### 2. Speed Benchmarking Script (`scripts/speed_benchmark.py`)

Command-line tool for running various speed benchmarks:

#### Benchmark Modes
```bash
# Quick validation for CI pipeline
python scripts/speed_benchmark.py --mode quick

# Comprehensive benchmark suite
python scripts/speed_benchmark.py --mode full

# Emergency mode focused testing
python scripts/speed_benchmark.py --mode emergency

# Before/after performance comparison
python scripts/speed_benchmark.py --mode comparison

# Custom query testing
python scripts/speed_benchmark.py --query "Apple Inc analysis"
```

#### Output Formats
- **JSON**: Structured benchmark data for analysis
- **Markdown**: Human-readable reports with recommendations

### 3. Quick Speed Demo (`scripts/quick_speed_demo.py`)

Standalone demonstration script that shows:
- Adaptive model selection in action
- Progressive token budgeting scaling
- Complexity-based optimizations
- Speed improvement claims validation
- Timeout resolution demonstration

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Makefile Integration

```bash
# Speed testing commands
make test-speed              # Run all speed optimization tests
make test-speed-quick        # Quick CI validation
make test-speed-emergency    # Emergency mode tests
make test-speed-comparison   # Before/after comparison

# Benchmarking commands
make benchmark-speed         # Comprehensive speed benchmark
```

### Continuous Integration

The framework supports CI integration through:
- **Quick validation mode**: Completes in <2 minutes for CI pipelines
- **Exit codes**: Non-zero exit for failed performance thresholds
- **Structured output**: Machine-readable results for automation

## Performance Thresholds

### Speed Thresholds
```python
SPEED_THRESHOLDS = {
    "simple_query_max_time": 15.0,      # Simple queries: <15s
    "moderate_query_max_time": 25.0,    # Moderate queries: <25s  
    "complex_query_max_time": 35.0,     # Complex queries: <35s
    "emergency_mode_max_time": 30.0,    # Emergency mode: <30s
    "minimum_speedup_factor": 2.0,      # Minimum 2x speedup
    "target_speedup_factor": 3.0,       # Target 3x speedup
    "timeout_failure_threshold": 0.05,  # Max 5% timeout failures
}
```

### Model Selection Validation
- **Emergency scenarios**: Must select models with 126+ tokens/second
- **Time budgets <30s**: Automatically use fastest available models
- **Complex analysis**: Can use slower, higher-quality models when time allows

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Emergency Mode Performance
Tests that urgent queries complete within strict time budgets:
```python
# Test emergency completion under 30s
result = await validator.test_emergency_mode_performance(
    "Quick Apple sentiment - bullish or bearish right now?"
)
assert result["execution_time"] < 30.0
assert result["within_budget"] == True
```

### 2. Adaptive Model Selection
Validates appropriate model selection based on time constraints:
```python
# Emergency scenario should select fastest model
config = selector.select_model_for_time_budget(
    task_type=TaskType.QUICK_ANSWER,
    time_remaining_seconds=10.0,
    complexity_score=0.3,
    content_size_tokens=200,
)
assert config.model_id in ["google/gemini-2.5-flash", "openai/gpt-4o-mini"]
```

### 3. Baseline vs Optimized Comparison
Compares performance improvements over baseline:
```python
# Test 2-3x speedup achievement
result = await validator.test_baseline_vs_optimized_performance(
    "Apple Inc comprehensive analysis", QueryComplexity.MODERATE
)
assert result["speedup_factor"] >= 2.0  # Minimum 2x improvement
```

### 4. Timeout Resolution
Validates that previous timeout issues are resolved:
```python
# Test scenarios that previously failed with 138s/129s timeouts
test_cases = ["Apple analysis", "Tesla outlook", "Microsoft assessment"]
for query in test_cases:
    result = await test_emergency_performance(query)
    assert result["execution_time"] < 30.0  # No more long timeouts
```

## Real-World Query Examples

### Simple Queries (Target: <15s)
- "Apple Inc current stock price and basic sentiment"
- "Tesla recent news and market overview" 
- "Microsoft quarterly earnings summary"

### Moderate Queries (Target: <25s)
- "Apple Inc comprehensive financial analysis and competitive position"
- "Tesla Inc market outlook considering EV competition and regulatory changes"
- "Microsoft Corp cloud business growth prospects and AI strategy"

### Complex Queries (Target: <35s)
- "Apple Inc deep fundamental analysis including supply chain risks, product lifecycle assessment, regulatory challenges across global markets, competitive positioning, and 5-year growth trajectory"

### Emergency Queries (Target: <30s)
- "Quick Apple sentiment - bullish or bearish right now?"
- "Tesla stock - buy, hold, or sell this week?"
- "Microsoft earnings - beat or miss expectations?"

## Optimization Features Validated
