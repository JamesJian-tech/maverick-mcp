"""
Comprehensive functional tests for DeepResearchAgent.

This test suite focuses on testing the actual research functionality including:

## Web Search Integration Tests (TestWebSearchIntegration):
- Exa and Tavily search provider query formatting and result processing
- Provider fallback behavior when APIs fail
- Search result deduplication from multiple providers
- Social media filtering and content processing

## Research Synthesis Tests (TestResearchSynthesis):
- Persona-aware content analysis with different investment styles
- Complete research synthesis workflow from query to findings
- Iterative research refinement based on initial results
- Fact validation and source credibility scoring

## Persona-Based Research Tests (TestPersonaBasedResearch):
- Conservative persona focus on stability, dividends, and risk factors
- Aggressive persona exploration of growth opportunities and innovation
- Day trader persona emphasis on short-term catalysts and volatility
- Research depth differences between conservative and aggressive approaches

## Multi-Step Research Workflow Tests (TestMultiStepResearchWorkflow):
- End-to-end research workflow from initial query to final report
- Handling of insufficient or conflicting information scenarios
- Research focusing and refinement based on discovered gaps
- Citation generation and source attribution

## Research Method Specialization Tests (TestResearchMethodSpecialization):
- Sentiment analysis specialization with news and social signals
- Fundamental analysis focusing on financials and company data
- Competitive analysis examining market position and rivals
- Proper routing to specialized analysis based on focus areas

## Error Handling and Resilience Tests (TestErrorHandlingAndResilience):
- Graceful degradation when search providers are unavailable
- Content analysis fallback when LLM services fail
- Partial search failure handling with provider redundancy
- Circuit breaker behavior and timeout handling

## Research Quality and Validation Tests (TestResearchQualityAndValidation):
- Research confidence calculation based on source quality and diversity
- Source credibility scoring (government, financial sites vs. blogs)
- Source diversity assessment for balanced research
- Investment recommendation logic based on persona and findings

## Key Features Tested:
- **Realistic Mock Data**: Uses comprehensive financial article samples
- **Provider Integration**: Tests both Exa and Tavily search providers
- **LangGraph Workflows**: Tests complete research state machine
- **Persona Adaptation**: Validates different investor behavior patterns
- **Error Resilience**: Ensures system continues operating with degraded capabilities
- **Research Logic**: Tests actual synthesis and analysis rather than just API calls

All tests use realistic mock data and test the research logic rather than just API connectivity.
26 test cases cover the complete research pipeline from initial search to final recommendations.
